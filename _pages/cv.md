<!-- 
Education
======
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, UCSD, expected 2023
  * Machine learning and controls depth, Overall GPA 3.97

Research experience
======
* Existential Robotics Laboratory, San Diego, CA: Summer 2022 - present
  * Advisor: Prof. Nikolay Atanasov
  * Tuning visual odometry algorithm DSOL for localization used in research. Produced code for photometric calibration of stereo cameras, which reduced closed loop error by 12%.
  * Assembled drone based on PX4 and revised position control code on onboard computer. Added safety takeover functionality.
  * Served as drone operator during flight tests.
  * Evaluated odometry algorithms' performance (MSCKF, DSOL) using Vicon motion capture system. Compiled findings as report.

* Xiaolong Wang's Lab, San Diego, CA: Summer 2021 - Spring 2022
  * Advisor: Prof. Xiaolong Wang
  * Handled transfer of trained policy in simulator to [unitree A1](https://www.unitree.com/a1/) robot: Overseen the process of real sensor input to match that in the training environment, developed a delay-sensitive structure to execute policy, and collected data of interest.
  * Self-studied basics of reinforcement learning via CS234 by Stanford online.
  * Collected experiment data for paper Vision-Guided Quadrupedal Locomotion in the Wild with Multi-Modal Delay Randomization [arxiv] with other team members. Accepted to IROS22. 
  * Learned to use Isaac Gym â€“ a parallel simulation environment for efficient reinforcement learning research.

Robotics experience
======
* Yonder Dynamics, San Diego, CA: Sep.2019 - Spring 2021
  * Developed simulation environment in gazebo, including a desert terrain and the URDF description of the rover. Set up multiple sensors with gazebo plugin, including IMU, camera, GPS, and stereo camera. 
  * Developed localization module capable of fusing IMU, GPS, magnetometer, and air pressure data into pose and twist.

* FRC 5449 & FTC 12527, Beijing, China: Jul.2012 - Sep.2019
  * Led the software team (~8 people) over 5 years of FTC & FRC competition. Held group meetings, discussed plans, and trained new members at the beginning of each season. Learned ideas such as linear algebra and vector mathematics first and introduced them to my fellow members.
  * Implemented various features/algorithms on robots, including PID control, motion planning & following, and localization based on odometry + computer vision (OpenCV).
  * Automated remote control with sensors to reduce the pressure of robot drivers during competition.
  * Volunteered to translate some of the rule videos.
