I am a robot enthusiast since inception of my middleschool, continuing my journey at Carnegie Mellon University in the Master's of Robotics program. I did my undergraduate in University of California, San Diego for Electrical Engineering Major with a depth in Mechine Learning and Control.  

Research interest
======
I see robots as the bridge between the digital world and the reality. I aim to become a research scientist and develop algorithms that would enable robots more intelligent to work for people in their daily lives. My current focus is preception for general purpose robots.
