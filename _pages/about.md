I am a robot enthusiast since inception of my middleschool, currently learning at the University of California, San Diego for Electrical Engineering Major with a depth in Mechine Learning and Control. I have applied to graduate robotics programs and is currently deciding my next step in robotics. 

Research interest
======
I see robots as the bridge between the digital world and the reality. I aim to become a research scientist and develop algorithms that would enable robots to locomote in current infrastructure, a prerequisite for performing manipulations. Specifically, I am interested in robot locomotion in unmodeled environments and online adaptation that accounts for model inaccuracies/hardware changes over time. Especially, I am interested in real-world verification of ideas.
