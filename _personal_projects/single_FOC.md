    <p> I want to make my powerhouse for my future robotics projects. The controller board senses the rotor's position from a magnetic encoder and modulates three phase voltage accordingly to achieve control goal. I have tuned the current loop to have a bandwidth of 2 kHz, and currently tuning the velocity and position loop. A command interface is also under construction. </p>
