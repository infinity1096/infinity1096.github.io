  <div class='image-description'>
    <p> I made a hand-held gimbal for stabilizing my phone when taking videos. The system cotains 3 BLDC motors and 2 IMUs, one at the handle and another attached to the end effector(phone holder). The difference between the IMU are used to calculate joint angles and guide the 3 phase voltage modulation. </p>
