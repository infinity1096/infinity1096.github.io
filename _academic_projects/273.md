    <p> I proved in details the convex relaxation portion of the paper Blind Deconvolution using Convex Program-
        ming and recreated its results. This project is completed with ECE273-convex optimization and greatly enhanced my understanding. My Instructor is Prof. Piya Pal. </p>

I recreated the results of paper [Blind Deconvolution using Convex Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5608) with my focus on justify the steps of how the original problem is relaxed twice into a convex problem, which can be solved efficiently and provide a approximate solution.
