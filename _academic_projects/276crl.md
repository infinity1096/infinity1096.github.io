    <p> I learned to use Isaac Gym and designed a network architecture that allows a high level network to select and combine appropriate low-level controllers. My network is proven to be beneficial. This is a course project instructed by Prof. Michael Yip. </p>

The selection of lower-level controllers are nontrivial
and task dependent. this paper proposed a network
architecture that learns to combine multiple low-level controllers.
Results shown better performance than traditional hybrid controller
but worse than the MPC implementation on the velocity
tracking task.
