We are preparing to use the direct method as in VO and formulate photometric error, I focused on photometric calibration when I learned and ported Direct Sparse Odometry Lite to our drone, which aims to provide localization in the wild and evaluate the importance of photometric calibration. I followed the manual photometric calibration paper from the TUM group and developed code to calculate the camera-response function and vignetting map. The calibration is proved to be useful for relative error metrics and prevents spikes in localization error.
