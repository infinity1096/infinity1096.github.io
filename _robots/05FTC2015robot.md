    <p>This is our robot for the FRC 2019 competition. It can deliver hatch panels and fuels(big inflated balls) over the competition field. It re-uses the elevator to push its back wheels up the climbing zone and use the giant cylinders to climb. In particular, we achieved autonomous pose drive using a double PID loop. </p>
